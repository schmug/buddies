# KiroCrew Website

React + TypeScript + Vite single-page app for the Kiro Crew dashboard. Built assets
are emitted to `dist/` and copied into the Python package at
`../src/kiro_crew/static/dist/` so the gateway can serve them.

## Develop

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies (public npm registry)
npm run dev          # Vite dev server on http://localhost:3000 (proxies API to the gateway on :5476)
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build        # tsc -b && vite build  → dist/
```

After building, stage `dist/` into the backend package so the gateway serves it.
Clear the destination first: Vite emits content-hashed filenames, so copying over an
existing bundle accumulates stale assets.

```bash
rm -rf ../src/kiro_crew/static/dist && cp -r dist ../src/kiro_crew/static/dist
```

## Test and lint

```bash
npm run typecheck       # tsc -b — application code
npm run typecheck:tests # test code, integration/ and playwright/
npm run lint            # eslint
npm run test            # website vitest suite + the Electron suite (a jscpd pretest runs first)
```

Application code and test code are two separate type-check projects, so both
commands are needed. Test layers, when to use which, and how Playwright really
runs: [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).
